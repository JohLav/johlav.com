As part of CareerFoundry's UX design program, I took on the challenge of conceptualizing Olive, a user-friendly healthcare app.

I conducted extensive user research and testing, employing a user-centered approach and following the design thinking process. Through my efforts, I developed a refined, high-fidelity prototype and created a comprehensive UI kit to support the design.

Motivated by the need to address challenges faced by health-conscious individuals in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I designed Olive as a responsive health and wellness portal. My work enabled users to log their health and medical information while accessing features that promote both physical and mental well-being.
